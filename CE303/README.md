This project includes the assignment required for the coursework aspect of the module, which consists of two versions of a client-server system using sockets. 
The requirements can be found within the assignment brief as well as the report produced.

The application follows the OOP Paradigm, thus each programming file only contains relevant objects to the class.

The folder 'src' AKA source file contains the application in Java, with each program split into the server side and client side, and the folder 'MarketCS' contains the application in C#, which is also split accordingly.
